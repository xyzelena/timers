## Timers 

Timers is a single-page application that allows the user to create countdown timers.
Each timer works independently, and the user can see the countdown in real time.

To implement this functionality, a closure for time management, an asynchronous setInterval function were used.

### Working example:

1. The user enters 10 in the field and clicks "Add timer".
2. A timer with an initial value of 10 appears on the screen, which decreases every second.
3. When the timer reaches 0, it is automatically deleted.
4. The user can manually delete the timer before it finishes.

### Stack: 

Pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS (no libraries).
